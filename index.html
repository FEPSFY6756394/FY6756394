     <h2 id ="Abstract"><b>Abstract</b></h2>
     <p1>The 2022 season proved a big step towards improved racing for drivers while also improving the spectacle for the fans. The aerodynamic innovation brought background effect cars to formula one aiming to reduce the amount of dirty air which is produced by a leading car. The new design philosophy significantly improves the level of downforces loss when a car is following a leading car. This results in trailing cars being able to follow leading cars more closely further increasing the overtaking opportunities. However, Ground effect brought challenges for teams as it created a huge safety risk for drivers causing the FIA to take action to eliminate these safety risks.

       <h2 id ="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
       <p2>2022 marked the beginning of a new era in formula one following a major aerodynamics overhaul. The purpose of such drastic changes to the regulations were to improve the racing and help bring each team closer in performance. The new generation of racing cars introduced new design philosophies and brought back aero features which were last used in the 1970s. 

         <h3 id ="Ground Effect"><b>Ground Effect</b></h3>
         <p3>Under the new regulations aerodynamic emphasis was placed on ground effect to ensure closer racing (Liberty Media, 2021).  Ground effect was first introduced in the 1970s to help reduce the levels of drag which is the by-product of disrupted air by the rear wing. By decreasing drag results in a higher top speed reached by the car on the straights at a track. Downforce is generated by low pressure on the surfaces nearest to the ground. Engineers exploited the venturi effect underneath the car. This is a phenomenon exhibited by fluids. This is used in practice where the underbody of the car is shaped in a way that air flow goes through a constricted point, resulting in an area of low pressure at that point. The low pressure sucks the car into the ground. Lotus was the first to adopt such a philosophy in 1977 on the Lotus 78 car which relied on skirts to force air through the venturi tunnels and make sure air did not escape out the sides of the floor. However, ground effect cars were banned in 1982 due to safety concerns. 

           <h3 id ="How do the new regulations improve racing?"><b>How do the new regulations improve racing?</b></h3> 
           <p4>“The 2022 regulations attempted to do two things, create cars that were less sensitive to a turbulent wake and generated less turbulence themselves” (Oracle Red Bull Racing, 2022). Additionally, the main aim of these ground-breaking regulations is improving the racing between competitors. Previously closer racing was prevented by the detrimental effects of dirty air which is produced by a leading car. Dirty air is heavily disrupted airflow which comes off a car resulting in following cars producing less downforce. This is due to less air flowing through downforce creating surfaces. The effects of following cars having less downforce heavily disrupts a cars ability to follow a leading car. However, under the new rule set, the FIA have attempted to try and minimise the effects of downforce loss. This was also a reason for the reintroduction of ground effect cars. The 2022 cars are now expected to lose 4% of their downforce at 20m from the leading car rising to just 18% at 10m. This is a significant improvement in comparison to the previous generation of cars which lost 35% 20m from the leading car and 47% of its downforce at 10m (Liberty Media, 2021). As a result, cars were able to follow leading cars causing more overtaking opportunities for each driver. Increased opportunities for overtaking further improved the spectacle for the whole sport as we saw backmarker teams manage to shock the entire paddock multiple times during 2022.
