     <h2 id ="Abstract"><b>Abstract</b></h2>
     <p1>The 2022 season proved a big step towards improved racing for drivers while also improving the spectacle for the fans. The aerodynamic innovation brought background effect cars to formula one aiming to reduce the amount of dirty air which is produced by a leading car. The new design philosophy significantly improves the level of downforces loss when a car is following a leading car. This results in trailing cars being able to follow leading cars more closely further increasing the overtaking opportunities. However, Ground effect brought challenges for teams as it created a huge safety risk for drivers causing the FIA to take action to eliminate these safety risks.</p1>

       <h2 id ="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
       <p2>2022 marked the beginning of a new era in formula one following a major aerodynamics overhaul. The purpose of such drastic changes to the regulations were to improve the racing and help bring each team closer in performance. The new generation of racing cars introduced new design philosophies and brought back aero features which were last used in the 1970s. 

         <h3 id ="Ground Effect"><b>Ground Effect</b></h3>
         <p3>Under the new regulations aerodynamic emphasis was placed on ground effect to ensure closer racing (Liberty Media, 2021).  Ground effect was first introduced in the 1970s to help reduce the levels of drag which is the by-product of disrupted air by the rear wing. By decreasing drag results in a higher top speed reached by the car on the straights at a track. Downforce is generated by low pressure on the surfaces nearest to the ground. Engineers exploited the venturi effect underneath the car. This is a phenomenon exhibited by fluids. This is used in practice where the underbody of the car is shaped in a way that air flow goes through a constricted point, resulting in an area of low pressure at that point. The low pressure sucks the car into the ground. Lotus was the first to adopt such a philosophy in 1977 on the Lotus 78 car which relied on skirts to force air through the venturi tunnels and make sure air did not escape out the sides of the floor. However, ground effect cars were banned in 1982 due to safety concerns. 

           <h3 id ="How do the new regulations improve racing?"><b>How do the new regulations improve racing?</b></h3> 
           <p4>“The 2022 regulations attempted to do two things, create cars that were less sensitive to a turbulent wake and generated less turbulence themselves” (Oracle Red Bull Racing, 2022). Additionally, the main aim of these ground-breaking regulations is improving the racing between competitors. Previously closer racing was prevented by the detrimental effects of dirty air which is produced by a leading car. Dirty air is heavily disrupted airflow which comes off a car resulting in following cars producing less downforce. This is due to less air flowing through downforce creating surfaces. The effects of following cars having less downforce heavily disrupts a cars ability to follow a leading car. However, under the new rule set, the FIA have attempted to try and minimise the effects of downforce loss. This was also a reason for the reintroduction of ground effect cars. The 2022 cars are now expected to lose 4% of their downforce at 20m from the leading car rising to just 18% at 10m. This is a significant improvement in comparison to the previous generation of cars which lost 35% 20m from the leading car and 47% of its downforce at 10m (Liberty Media, 2021). As a result, cars were able to follow leading cars causing more overtaking opportunities for each driver. Increased opportunities for overtaking further improved the spectacle for the whole sport as we saw backmarker teams manage to shock the entire paddock multiple times during 2022.</p4> 
   <h3 id ="Challenges during 2022 due to the regulations"><b>Challenges during 2022 due to the regulations</b></h3> 
           <p5>At the start of the 2022 season, many teams interpreted the regulations differently however every team encountered the exact same problem throughout the year. Cars experienced bouncing which is known as porpoising. This phenomenon is impossible to be simulated at any factory therefore the cars became unpredictable from track to track. At high speeds, the floor of the car is too close to the ground resulting in an even more powerful ground affect. Due to this there is an increases pressure different between lower and higher surfaces on the car further increasing the downforce. Eventually the airflow stalls under the car causing the load to be released and results in the car rising again (Gadola, Chindamo, Magri and Sandrini, 2022). This follows a cyclic pattern hence why we saw cars bouncing along the straights at racetracks. The bouncing that was caused by the floor sparked many safety concerns for the drivers who complained about injuries sustained from races. Additionally, drivers had to lift off on the straights to prevent porpoising however this reduced the straightline speed which was detrimental to lap times. To prevent this challenge the FIA released a technical directive instructing teams to take the acceptable measures to minimise porpoising ensuring the safety of the drivers. This directive forced teams to “Closer scrutiny of the planks and skids, both in terms of their design and the observed wear” (FIA,2022). This ensured that teams kept their cars at an acceptable ride height and this is examined by inspecting the plank which is attached to the floor. </p5> 

      <h3 id ="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h3> 
           <p6>This paper highlights the significant shift in aerodynamic regulations in formula one and identifies how this affects the racing in this sport. In this paper I examined the innovations used to help move on from outdated concepts from the previous generation of F1 cars. I researched how much significance ground effect has identifying the advantages of it and the disadvantages of it. This paper analyses the attempts made to minimise the effect of dirty air which creates serious problems for cars following a leading car resulting in a loss of downforce. specific problems have been explained on the risks which have been involved in incorporating ground effect due to porpoising posing as a safety hazard for the drivers. However, ways to eliminate those risks have been outlined. In conclusion ground effect has brought challenges for teams however solutions have been created for it to be a success in formula one.</p6>
