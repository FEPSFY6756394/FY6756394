     <h2 id ="Abstract"><b>Abstract</b></h2>
     <p1>The 2022 season proved a big step towards improved racing for drivers while also improving the spectacle for the fans. The aerodynamic innovation brought background effect cars to formula one aiming to reduce the amount of dirty air which is produced by a leading car. The new design philosophy significantly improves the level of downforces loss when a car is following a leading car. This results in trailing cars being able to follow leading cars more closely further increasing the overtaking opportunities. However, Ground effect brought challenges for teams as it created a huge safety risk for drivers causing the FIA to take action to eliminate these safety risks.
